        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p><strong>Born in Portland, Oregon on <time datetime="1987-08-05">5 August 1987</time>. Raised in Terre Haute, Indiana and Louisville, Kentucky. Currently based in Knoxville, Tennessee.</strong></p>
        <p>His mother was born in the greater Louisville area (New Albany, Indiana), and he spent much of his childhood visiting family in Louisville. It became a second home and a major musical influence. Maternal family roots in the Louisville area span many generations.</p>
        <p>He lived in Terre Haute from ages 3 to 19 and attended school there, with frequent trips to Louisville for family and shows. After high school he studied Recording Arts at Full Sail University in Winter Park, Florida and earned an AS. He moved to the Louisville area in 2008 and remained there until March 2023, then lived with family in Bradenton and Vero Beach through August 2023, followed by a move to Northern Virginia (Leesburg). In August 2024 he relocated to Knoxville, Tennessee, where he currently resides.</p>
        <p>Gabriel Long is beareab. The project emphasizes authenticity and vulnerability. It is a practice in self-therapy and integration of shadow and all parts. Fragmentation is treated as a teacher and music as the process.</p>
        <p>He has been writing and playing guitar since 2000 and began releasing music as beareab in 2025. Drawing on underground hardcore and experimental roots, his work fuses raw emotion with intricate guitar textures.</p>

    <section class="about-section">
      <h3>Philosophy and approach</h3>
      <p>At its core, beareab pursues honesty. Music can mirror inner landscapes and help acknowledge and integrate parts that are often avoided. Each composition is built for tension and release that reflects healing and self-discovery.</p>
      <p>Whether working alone or collaborating in the underground scene, he maintains a DIY ethos. He has a background in audio production and avoids over-polished methods in favor of techniques developed across twenty-four years of recording. The focus is on immediacy, performance, and authenticity.</p>
