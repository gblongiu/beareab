        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>
          Gabriel Long is the musician, songwriter, and producer behind beareab. Born in
          the Pacific Northwest and raised in the Midwest, he’s been writing and playing
          guitar since 2000, but only began releasing music under the beareab moniker in 2025.
          Drawing on his underground hardcore and experimental roots, his work fuses raw emotion
          with intricate guitar textures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Across three releases: Psion, the beareab / eyesplice split, and
          Solace, Gabriel explores themes of shadow integration and self-therapy.
          His recordings blend harsh dynamics, dissonant riffing, and moments of fragile melody
          to confront and express the hidden corners of the psyche.

      <h3>Philosophy &amp; Approach</h3>
      <p>
        At its core, beareab is an exercise in honesty. Gabriel believes music can mirror our
        inner landscapes, helping us acknowledge and integrate the parts of ourselves we often
        shy away from. Each composition is crafted to evoke tension and release, mirroring the
        process of healing and self-discovery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether working alone in his home studio or collaborating with peers in the underground
        scene, Gabriel maintains a DIY ethos. He has a degree in audio production and purposefully,
        rejects the over polished methodologies he was taught. He instead opts for lo-fi techniques
        he has developed in his 24 years of recording experience. His focus on the immediacy of
        artfulness / capturing performance and authenticty above all else.
