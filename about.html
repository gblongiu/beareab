        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>Gabriel Long is the musician, songwriter, and producer behind beareab. Born in the Pacific Northwest and raised in the Midwest, he has been writing and playing guitar since 2000, but only began releasing music under the beareab moniker in 2025. Drawing on underground hardcore and experimental roots, his work fuses raw emotion with intricate guitar textures.</p>
        <p>Across three releases — Psion, the beareab and eyesplice split, and Solace — Gabriel explores themes of shadow integration and self-therapy. His recordings blend harsh dynamics, dissonant riffing, and moments of fragile melody to confront and express the hidden corners of the psyche.

      <h3>Philosophy &amp; Approach</h3>
      <p>At its core, beareab is an exercise in honesty. Gabriel believes music can mirror our inner landscapes, helping us acknowledge and integrate the parts of ourselves we often shy away from. Each composition is crafted to evoke tension and release, which mirrors the process of healing and self-discovery.</p>
      <p>Whether working alone in his home studio or collaborating with peers in the underground scene, Gabriel maintains a DIY ethos. He has a degree in audio production and purposefully rejects the over-polished methodologies he was taught, opting instead for lo-fi techniques he developed over 24 years of recording experience. The focus is on immediacy of performance and authenticity above all else.</p>
