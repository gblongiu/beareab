          Psion spans five years of fracture and reconstruction. One of these songs was written in the isolation
          of 2020, during the peak of the pandemic, when everything felt unreal. The others came later, built from
          riffs I wrote in the spring of 2023. The vocals and drums were completed in the week leading up to release.
        </p>
        <p>
          This release is anxious, raw, and densely layered. It moves quickly but never feels careless. Spoken word
          unravels into screaming. Melodic foundations crumble into dissonance. Nothing here is clean. It is a deeply
          personal exposition of emotional catharsis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Psion came out of a period of recognition. I began to see the shape of my own emotional patterns. How I was
          participating in the damage I thought was being done to me. These songs carry that realization, but not
          resolution. Only awareness. The fight was never with the outside world. It was always internal.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is my most aggressive release to date. It is also the most focused. Not because I have the answers,
          but because I stopped pretending to.
